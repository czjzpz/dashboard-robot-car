**A small dashboard to get an Elegoo Smart Car controlled by any computer!**

To get it running,
- 1: Connect to the car's WiFi 
- 2: get the FastAPI for the control endpoints (https://github.com/czjzpz/fastapi-robot-car)
- 3: ensure the heartbeat is running, test the ESP32 stream alongwith the FastAPI app, and go!

**CURRENTLY**, I have plans to add in YOLO computer vision and certain other abilities that will make the car able to detect objects and drive towards them while intelligently steering away from obstacles.
